# Power-of-Plots

# Observations
1. Capomulin works well becuase tumor volume decreases over time.
2. Even distibution of genders.
3. Strong correlaiton between mouse weight and average tumor volume.

# Summary of Task
In this study, 249 mice identified with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. SSC is a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. The executive team of Pymaceuticals asked for tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study and for a top-level summary of the study results.
